\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
$<$Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this
document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the
product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only
part of the system or a single subsystem.$>$


\section{Project Scope}
$<$Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose,
including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to
corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document
is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.$>$

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
$<$Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for,
such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and
documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is
organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the
overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to
each reader type.$>$

\section{Definitions Acronyms and Abbreviations}
$<$Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for,
such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and
documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is
organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the
overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to
each reader type.$>$

\section{Document Conventions}
$<$Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when
writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance.
For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are assumed
to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement
is to have its own priority.$>$


\section{References}
$<$List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may
include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements
specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide
enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference,
including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.$>$


\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external
interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functionality}
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{Users and Characteristics}
$<$Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product
functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational
level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.
Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the
most important user classes for this product from those who are less important
to satisfy.$>$

\section{Operating Environment}
$<$Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the
hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software
components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.$>$

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
$<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the
developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware
limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other
applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel
operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security
considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the
customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered
software).$>$

\section{User Documentation}
$<$List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help,
and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any
known user documentation delivery formats or standards.$>$

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$


\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{External Interface Requirements}

\section{Functional Requirements}

\section{Behavior Requirements}


\chapter{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
$<$If there are performance requirements for the product under various
circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
$<$Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or
harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or
actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to
any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the
product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be
satisfied.
Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use
of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define
any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or
regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any
security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.$>$

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be
important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are:
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability,
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability,
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes,
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\chapter{Other Requirements}
$<$Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might
include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal
requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections
that are pertinent to the project.$>$
